## Enacted Injection Strategies

The injection process is systematically divided into distinct segments, each offering a variety of methods. To gain access to the desired target process, you have several options:

Utilizing official Windows API functions such as OpenProcess() and WriteProcessMemory().
Replicating an existing handle to the target process.

Leveraging capabilities provided by a kernel module.
The user interface is inherently user-friendly. Choosing the injection target process involves a simple drag-and-drop action of a locator onto the target window, illustrated below:

Once the target is selected, you have the flexibility to choose the injection method, followed by a confirmatory action.
This fundamental DLL loader (injector) is specifically designed for diverse game cheats. The orchestrated mechanism enables the remote loading of the DLL from a server and its integration into the game through manual mapping (credited to Guidedhacking Broihon). This unique approach ensures that the .dll (game hack) bypasses the hard drive, taking a direct route into memory.

## Rationale Behind Another DLL Injector

The inception of this project was fueled by the desire for sheer enjoyment, to delve into the realm of .Net GUI development, and to engage in hands-on exploration of a myriad of established DLL injection technologies. It stands as a testament to the amalgamation of curiosity and learning, a journey undertaken to expand horizons and enrich one's skill set.
